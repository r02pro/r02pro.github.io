[["boxplots.html", "3.14 Boxplots", " 3.14 Boxplots So far, we have learned two ways to visualize a continuous variable, namely the histograms (Section 3.12) and density plots (Section 3.13). Now, we introduce another popular plot for visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable, namely the boxplot. Let’s say we want to generate a boxplot for the variable sale_price in the sahp dataset. 3.14.1 Using the boxplot() function To generate a boxplot, you can just use boxplot() with the variable as the argument. library(r02pro) boxplot(sahp$sale_price) The boxplot compactly summarize the distribution of a continuous variable by visualizing five summary statistics (the median, two hinges, and two whiskers), and show all “outlying” points individually. All five summary statistics on the boxplot are related to the summary statistics we learned in Section 2.5. Let’s first review the summary function. summary(sahp$sale_price) On the boxplot, the solid line in the middle represents the median value, which is 157.95. The lower solid line, also known as the lower hinge, is Q1 = 129.9625. The upper solid line, also known as the upper hinge, is Q3 = 201.575. The lower whisker is the smallest observation greater than or equal to Q1 - 1.5 * IQR. Let’s find out the value together. First, we calculate Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 18 - 1.59 From the result of the summary function, the smallest observation larger than 4.5 is 12. Similarly, the upper whisker is the largest observation less than or equal to Q3 + 1.5 IQR Again, let’s calculate it together. We have Q3 + 1.5 * IQR 27 + 1.5*9 From the top to bottom, they are upper whisker (&lt;= Q3 + 1.5*IQR) upper hinge (Q3) median (50-th percentile) lower hinge (Q1) lower whisker (&gt;= Q1 - 1.5*IQR) "]]
