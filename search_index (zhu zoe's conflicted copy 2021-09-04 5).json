[["na.html", "2.8 Missing Values (NA)", " 2.8 Missing Values (NA) In applications, we often encounter the situation where some observations are missing in the data set. In this scenario, R uses NA to represent those observations, indicating they are not available. Let’s see the following example. a &lt;- 1:10 a[11] #&gt; [1] NA Since we define a as a vector of length 10, when we try to access the 11th element of a, it is not available, showing a value of NA. 2.8.1 NA is Contagious NA represents that the underlying value is not available. As a result, for most operations associated with NA, the results will also be NA, showing that NA is contagious. y &lt;- NA y + 3 #&gt; [1] NA y == 3 #&gt; [1] NA As you can see here, since y is NA, indicating the value of y is not available. When you try to calculate y + 3 or y == 3, the answers are clearly not available as well, hence both taking the value NA. The same thing happens when you try to do operations between an NA object and any other object. x &lt;- 3 y + x y == x How about we create another NA object and compare it with y? z &lt;- NA y == z It is again NA, which may be confusing at first. However, keep in mind that since both y and z are not available, there is no way to tell whether they are the same. 2.8.2 Statistical functions on vectors with NA Now, let’s talk about what impact the NA values make for statistical functions. x &lt;- c(1, NA, 3, 4, NA, 2) x sum(x) mean(x) sd(x) 2.8.3 Work with NA values a. find missing values b. exclude missing values c. ignore and recode missing values d. replace non-standard missing values with NA in the vector 2.8.4 Exercises "]]
