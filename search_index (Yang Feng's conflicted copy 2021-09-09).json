[["set-operations.html", "2.8 Set Operations", " 2.8 Set Operations In Section 2.7, we introduced logical operators which are operators on logical vectors. Now, we discuss the operations between sets. Letâ€™s begin by defining two vectors. x &lt;- c(1, 2, 1, 3) y &lt;- c(1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5) To get values in both x and y, you can use the intersect() function. intersect(x, y) #&gt; [1] 1 3 Note that although both x and y have two elements of 1, the result of their intersection only has one 1, showing that only the unique elements are retained in the output.
