[["histogram.html", "3.12 Histograms", " 3.12 Histograms In Section 3.10, we learned how to use geom_bar() to generate bar charts for visualizing the distributions of discrete variables. You may be wondering, how about visualizing continuous variables? One popular plot is called histograms. Let’s again use the sahp housing price dataset. 3.12.1 Using the hist() function To generate a histogram, you can simply use hist() with the variable as the argument. library(r02pro) hist(sahp$sale_price) On the x-axis, the histogram displays the range of values for the sale price. Then, the histogram divides the x-axis into bins with equal width, and a bar is erected over the bin with the y-axis showing the corresponding number of observations (called Frequency on the y-axis label). 3.12.2 Using the geom_histogram() function In addition to using the hist() function in base R. The geom_histogram() function in the ggplot2 package provides richer functionality. Let’s take a quick look. library(ggplot2) ggplot(data = sahp) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = sale_price)) #&gt; `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. #&gt; Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). We could see a message, saying “stat_bin() using bins = 30” which implies the histogram has 30 bins by default. We can change the number of bins with the global aesthetic bins. ggplot(data = sahp) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = sale_price), bins = 5) #&gt; Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). ggplot(data = sahp) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = sale_price), binwidth = 1e2) #&gt; Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). ggplot(data = sahp) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = sale_price), breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 600, by = 100)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 120, by = 5)) #&gt; Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). #verify the first bin count sum(sahp$sale_price &lt; 1e5) 3.12.3 Aesthetics in geom_histogram() ggplot(data = sahp) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = sale_price, fill = house_style), bins = 5) #&gt; Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). a. stacked bars ggplot(data = sahp) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = sale_price, fill = house_style), position = &quot;stack&quot;, bins = 5) #&gt; Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). b. dodged bars ggplot(data = sahp) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = sale_price, fill = house_style), position = &quot;dodge&quot;, bins = 5) #&gt; Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). c. filled bars ggplot(data = sahp) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = sale_price, fill = house_style), position = &quot;fill&quot;, bins = 5) #&gt; Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
