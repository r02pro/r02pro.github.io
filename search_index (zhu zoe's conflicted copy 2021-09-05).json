In particular, R Markdown follows the syntax of Pandoc’s Markdown, a set of markup annotations for plain text files. Pandoc (https://pandoc.org/) is a universal document converter that converts documents from one markup format into another. Here, text in the .Rmd file is called the marked up text, and text in the output document is called the formatted text. When you knit the .Rmd file, Pandoc transforms the marked up text into formatted text in the specified file format. In this section, we will introduce how to get several kinds of formatted text in the output document by compiling the .Rmd file. 10.2.1 Special text Formats Firstly, let’s discuss how to generate a couple of special formatted text. a. different header levels You may use different numbers of “#” before the marked up text to generate different header levels in the output document. (with more “#”s indicating lower levels and smaller fonts). For example, you can try to type the following lines in the .Rmd file and see what will happen in the output document, # Header1 ## Header2 ### Header3 #### Header4 ##### Header5 ###### Header6 b. change the text into italic type To make the formatted text into italic type, you can simply use a pair of \"\" around the marked up text with no space. For example italic* in the .Rmd file generates italic in the output document. c. change the text into bold type To make the formatted text into bold type, you can simply use a pair of \"\" around the marked up text with no space. For example bold** in the .Rmd file generates bold in the output document. d. highlight a piece of code To highlight a piece of code in the formatted text, you can use a pair of “\" around the code outside the code chunk with no space. For example \"summary(cars)\" in the .Rmd file generatessummary(cars)in the output document. Notice that if you add a pair of \"” around codes inside the the code chunk, you will get an error message after knitting. e. insert hyperlinks To insert a hyperlink in the output document, you can use the format [link](address) in the .Rmd file. For example, [r02pro](https://r02pro.github.io/) in the .Rmd file will generate the text r02pro with hyperlink to this book in the output document. f. write latex equations When writing documents that contain math symbols or equations, you can use latex equations directly in an R Markdown file, just like writing a .tex file. For example, you can use $\\sum_{i=1}^{10} i = 55$ to get \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{10} i= 55\\). You can also use a pair of $$ to write in display math mode. Say $$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} i = 55$$ will generate \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{10} i = 55\\] "],["header1.html", "Chapter 11 Header1 ", " Chapter 11 Header1 "],["header2.html", "11.1 Header2", " 11.1 Header2 11.1.1 Header3 11.1.1.1 Header4 11.1.1.1.1 Header5 11.1.1.1.1.1 Header6 italics bold code Please see the following example which has all components introduced here. # H1 *This is an example.* ## H2 I **learned** to use `a &lt;- rnorm(1)` to generating normal distributed random variable in [r02pro](https://r02pro.github.io/). ### H3 I learned how to sum up numbers when I was young. For example, $$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} i = 55$$ 11.1.2 Lists and tables There are two kinds of lists in R Markdown, unordered lists and ordered lists. To create an unordered list, you can use the symbol *, +, or - at the beginning of the line with a space between the symbol and the text. To create higher order lists, you just need to add extra space at the beginning of the line. * Item 1 * Item 2 + Item 2a - Item 2a.a - Item 2a.b + Item 2b * Item 3 + Item 3a Item 1 Item 2 Item 2a Item 2a.a Item 2a.b Item 2b Item 3 Item 3a To create an ordered list, you can use numbers followed by the contents with a space in between. Of course, you can mix the unordered list inside. 1. Item 1 2. Item 2 + Item 2a - Item 2a.a - Item 2a.b + Item 2b 3. Item 3 + Item 3a Item 1 Item 2 Item 2a Item 2a.a Item 2a.b Item 2b Item 3 Item 3a In addition to lists, you can easily create tables using R Markdown using the kable() function in the knitr package. ```{r echo = FALSE, results = TRUE} Code &lt;- c(&quot;`dnorm(x, mean, sd)`&quot;,&quot;`pnorm(q, mean, sd)`&quot;,&quot;`qnorm(p, mean, sd)`&quot;,&quot;`rnorm(n, mean, sd)`&quot;) Name &lt;- c(&quot;probability density function&quot;, &quot;cumulative distribution function&quot;, &quot;quantile function&quot;, &quot;random number generator&quot;) d &lt;- data.frame(Code, Name) knitr::kable(d) ``` Code Name dnorm(x, mean, sd) probability density function pnorm(q, mean, sd) cumulative distribution function qnorm(p, mean, sd) quantile function rnorm(n, mean, sd) random number generator 11.1.3 Insert citations and manage bibliographies R Markdown provides us the capability to add bibliography and manage citations with ease, similar to writing a LaTex document. To add citations, you first need to add the bibliography filed in the YAML head. If your references are in the file “references.bib,” you can set the bibliography file as follows. --- output: html_document bibliography: references.bib --- The .bib file is a plain-text file that consists of bibliography entries like the following: @book{r02pro, title = {R Programming: From Zero to Pro}, author = {Yang Feng and Jianan Zhu}, organization = {New York University}, address = {New York, NY}, year = {2021}, url = {https://r02pro.github.io/}, } Then, each bibtex items can be cited directly within the documentation using the syntax @key, where key is the citation key in the first line of the entry, e.g., @r02pro will show as Feng and Zhu (2021) in the document. To put citations in parentheses, use [@key]. To cite more than one items, separate the keys by semicolons, e.g., [@key-a; @key-b; @key-c]. To suppress the author name, add a minus sign before @, e.g., [-@r02pro]. To learn more about citations and bibliography, you can read the excellent book by Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer (2020).
