[["summary-r-objects.html", "3.7 Summary of R Objects", " 3.7 Summary of R Objects Through the last chapter and this one, we have covered all major types of R objects including vectors, matrices, arrays, data frames (tibbles), and lists. In this section, we would like to summarize what we have covered and highlight the main differences of the different types of objects in terms of their dimensions and the data types they can contain. Type Section Dim Data Type Vector 2 1 Single Matrix 3.1 2 Single Array 3.2 &gt;=3 Single Data Frame/Tibble 3.3 - 3.4 2 Multiple List 3.5 1 Multiple 3.7.1 Exercises This exercise will guide you through various R operations using a dataset of animals in a zoo. You will practice creating and manipulating vectors, matrices, and data frames, as well as performing basic calculations and filtering. Suppose there are 3 lions, 5 tigers, 7 birds, and 2 monkeys in the zoo. Creating Vectors Create a numeric vector named count that stores the number of each animal: lions, tigers, birds, and monkeys. Create a character vector named animal that stores the names of these animals in the same order. Combining Vectors Combine the count and animal vectors into a new vector zoo_1 &lt;- c(count, animal). What is the data type of zoo_1? Why does it has such a data type? What are the implications of this for numerical calculations? Creating a Matrix Combine the count and animal vectors into a matrix zoo_2 &lt;- cbind(count, animal). What is the data type of zoo_2? Explain why this occurs and how R handles the different data types within a matrix. Creating a Data Frame Create a data frame named zoo_df using the count and animal vectors. Ensure that the data frame has appropriate column names. Display the structure of the data frame using the str() function. What are the data types of each column? Updating the Data Frame Two birds have escaped from the zoo. Update the zoo_df data frame to decrease the bird count by 2. Verify the update by displaying the zoo_df data frame. Filtering the Data Frame Extract and display only the rows of zoo_df that correspond to lions and tigers using subsetting. Adding New Data The zoo has acquired 6 pandas. Add a new row to zoo_df for the pandas with the appropriate count and animal name. Display the updated data frame. Calculating the Total Number of Animals Calculate the total number of animals in the zoo without using the + operator. Adding a Placeholder Row The zoo manager plans to add parrots to the zoo, but he doesn’t know the exact number yet. Add a row for “parrots” with a placeholder value of NA for the count. Display the updated data frame to confirm the change. Calculating the Median Count The zoo manager decides that the number of parrots should be set to the median of the existing animal counts. Calculate the median count, excluding any NA values. Update the count for parrots in the data frame to this median value. Display the final data frame.
