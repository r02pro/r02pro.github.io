[["other-distributions.html", "9.2 Other Distributions", " 9.2 Other Distributions In Section 9.1, we gave a detailed introduction to the four functions for a normal distribution, which is a popular continuous distribution. In particular, we now know that dnorm() produces the pdf of a normal distribution. In the case of discrete distributions, however, we would have probability mass function (pmf) instead of the pdf. Let’s use the binomial distribution as a representative example of discrete distributions with the four functions as below. Code Name dbinom(3, size, prob) probability mass function pbinom(3, size, prob) cumulative distribution function qbinom(3, size, prob) quantile function rbinom(3, size, prob) random number generator Now, let’s look at a few other commonly used distributions. For simplicity, let’s just use the random number generator for each distribution in the following table. Name Code para_1 para_2 exponential rexp(3, rate = 0.5) rate - uniform runif(3, min = 1, max = 2) min max t rt(3, df = 4) df - F rf(3, df1 = 3, df2 = 6) df1 df2 beta rbeta(3, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 3) shape1 shape2 gamma rgamma(3, shape = 2, rate = 3) shape rate poisson rpois(3, lambda = 5) lambda - binomial rbinom(3, size = 3, prob = 0.3) size prob bernoulli rbinom(3, size = 1, prob = 0.5) size prob As we can see from this table, all random number generator functions are formed by the letter r followed by the name of the distribution we would like to generate from. For the other three functions, we just need to change the initial letter r: to d for pdf (continuous distribution) or pmf (discrete distribution), to p for cdf, to q for quantile function. Let’s do some statistical exercise with those distributions. 9.2.1 Exercise You can run the following code to do the exercise. r02pro(&quot;8.2&quot;) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
